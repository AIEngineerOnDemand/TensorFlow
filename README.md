## TensorFlow's Keras Model Class

The `Model` class in `tensorflow.keras` is a high-level API that is used for defining a neural network model. It groups layers into an object with training and inference features.

Here's a simple example of how to use it:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import Model, layers

class MyModel(Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')
        self.flatten = layers.Flatten()
        self.d1 = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.d2 = layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.d1(x)
        return self.d2(x)

# Create an instance of the model
model = MyModel()

## Explanation of TensorFlow Training Step

The `train_step` function is a single step in the training of a TensorFlow model. Here's what each part does:


```python
@tf.function
``` This decorator tells TensorFlow to compile the function using TensorFlow's graph mode, which can provide significant speedups.
